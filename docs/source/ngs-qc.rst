Quality control
***************


Introduction
############

1. We know that none of the described sequencing technologies is perfect; thus, they will generate different **types** and **amounts** of **errors**.

2. It this, therefore of utmost importance to **identify** the errors that may influence further data analysis and interpretation.

3. In this section, you will first learn how to visualize the quality of the data using |fastqc| and |multiqc|.

4. After that, we will **trim** and **filter** low quality or uninformative reads/bases through |bbduk|.

5. You will be working only with the paired-end raw data acquired through the **Illumina HiSeq 2500** Platform [GREIG2019]_.


Learning objectives
###################

After finishing this Tutorial section, you will be able to:

* Calculate the sequencing coverage.
* Generate a full combined quality report.
* Assess and interpret the general quality of raw reads.
* Improve the quality of raw reads by trimming, masking and filtering.


Coverage
########

1. As you already saw in the theoretical classes, a sequencing platform needs to sequence every base in a given sample several times.

2. The number of ``x`` times a genome has been sequenced (depth of sequencing) is expressed by a **coverage metric**.

3. There are not recommendations for ideal sequencing coverage. Most researchers determine the necessary coverage based on the type of study and available literature.

4. Ideal coverage for a genome assembly should be **50x or above** [ALBERT2019]_. It means that each base on average is sequenced 50 times.

.. hint::
   The coverage can be calculated using the following equations.

   **A. For an instrument with fixed read length:**

   ``C = LN / G``

   C: Coverage

   L: is the read length in bp (e.g. 2x100 paired-end = 200)

   N: is the number of sequenced reads

   G: is the haploid genome length in bp

   **B. For an instrument with variable read length:**

   ``C = SUM(Li) / G``

   C: Coverage

   Li: is the length of read *i* in bp

   G: is the haploid genome length in bp

Let's try to do some basic analysis and calculate the coverage using the **paired-end Illumina raw reads** (files SRR6052929 and SRR7184397).

.. todo::
   1. Open the file with the command line or with the text editor to get an idea about the structure.
   2. What is the unique identifier of the FastQC files?
   3. How many raw sequence reads are in the files?
   4. Calculate the coverage, assuming a genome size of ~5.5 MB.


Visualisation of data quality
#############################

1. The first step after receiving the sequencing data is to perform some simple quality control evaluations.

2. This step will be important to ensure that your raw data looks good and there are no problems or biases.

2. For that, youâ€™ll first use two programs called |fastqc| and |multiqc|, to visualize the quality of the raw reads.


FastQC
******

* We already saw in section 2.5.3 that to each base is assigned a |phred| quality score.

* In this section, we will see how to visualize all these scores collectively using |fastqc|.

* Also, |fastqc| will allow you to:

  1. Create user-friendly **plots** and **tables** to assess the general quality and composition of raw sequence data.
  2. Identify any **problems** originated either in the sequencer or in the starting library material.
  3. Export the results to an **HTML** based reports.

.. note::
   Don't forget that fastq errors are not entirely accurate measures, hence use them as **warnings** for further analysis.


Installation
............

Quality control
###############

1. In the previous section, we have **evaluated** and **visualised** the quality of our raw sequence reads using |fastqc|.

2. Now you have to decide if your data should be subject to **Quality Control (QC)**, i.e. the process of improving data by removing identifiable errors from it.

3. You must remember that by performing QC we can also introduce **errors** (we want the same data but with better quality); thus, we should not perform QC if the quality appears to be satisfactory.

.. attention::
   Only perform QC if your data need it. Whether you should quality-trim, and what the threshold should be, depends on your **data quality** and their **intended use**. Often a threshold of **~10** is pretty good for most of the cases.


BBDuk
*****

If your data needs QC you can use |bbduk| to trim adapters and filter other low-quality data. |bbduk| can run in trimming mode or filtering mode.


Installation
............

.. warning::

   * To run |bbtools|, you need to have **Java 7** or higher installed on the computer.

   * You can install Java through conda ``conda install -c anaconda java-1.7.0-openjdk-cos6-x86_64``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Deactivate all current environments
    $ conda deactivate

    # Let's first create a new directory to keep the clean raw sequence reads
    $ cd ~/tutorial/
    $ mkdir qc_improvement
    $ cd

    # Download the latest version of BBTools from Sourceforge to your computer
    $ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/files/latest/download/BBMap_38.98.tar.gz

    # Go to the parent directory where you have BBTools file
    $ cd <installation path parent directory>

    # Extract the file contents to your installation folder on the computer
    $ tar -xvzf BBMap_(version).tar.gz

    # To test the installation run stats.sh against the PhiX reference genome located in ~/bbmap/resources
    # At the end you should see some statistics in your shell
    $ ~/bbmap/stats.sh in=(installation directory)/resources/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz


Usage
.....

**1. Input/Output files**

``Input``: You will use the Illumina raw sequence data contained in the ``.fastq`` files.

``Output``: BBDuk will generate ``.fastq`` files containing your sequence data trimmed and filtered according to the input parameters.

**2. Basic commands**

.. note::

   * When you have the **paired-end reads** in 2 files you should **always processed them together**, not one at a time.

   * In the commands provided below don't forget to add the full path of your ``fastq.gz`` files.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Go to the directory where you want to keep the trimmed data
    $ cd ~/tutorial/qc_improvement/

    # Trim adapters when present in the raw sequence reads
    # For this example we will use a fasta file containing all adapters (adapters.fasta) that should be located in ~/bbmap/resources
    $ ~/bbmap/bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=read1.fastq.gz in2=read2.fastq.gz out1=clean1.fastq out2=clean2.fastq ref=adapters.fasta ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1 tpe tbo

    # Trim regions with an average quality below 10
    $ ~/bbmap/bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=read1.fastq.gz in2=read2.fastq.gz out1=clean1.fastq out2=clean2.fastq qtrim=rl trimq=10

    # Discard raw sequence reads with average quality below 10
    $ ~/bbmap/bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=read1.fastq.gz in2=read2.fastq.gz out1=clean1.fastq out2=clean2.fastq maq=10

    # Trim regions with an average quality below 10 and discard reads with average quality below 5 after trimming
    $ ~/bbmap/bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=read1.fastq.gz in2=read2.fastq.gz out1=clean1.fastq out2=clean2.fastq trimq=10 maq=5

    # Optionally you can also evaluate all raw reads length and display basic statistics
    $ ~/bbmap/readlength.sh in=reads.fastq.gz out=histogram.txt
