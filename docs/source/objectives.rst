Objectives
**********

In this Tutorial, you will learn how to acquire, process, and analyze raw next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from single-cell sequencing.

.. attention::
   * This is not a mandatory, exhaustive, or official pipeline. The appropriated pipeline will depend on the **type of data** that you have and the main **objectives**.
   * The pipeline that is provided in just an **example** of one of the approaches.
   * Since **new tools and packages** are continually being developed, you may need to **update your pipeline** to include the best ones that fit your purpose.


What you'll learn
#################

The following topics will be covered:

  - Acquisition of NGS raw reads
  - Raw reads evaluation and cleaning
  - Species identification
  - De novo assembly and quality control
  - Genome annotation
  - Resistome and virulome analysis


What you'll build
#################

  - A complete or draft microbial genome
  - A report of specific genotypic features
  - A comparative genomic analysis
