In this tutorial you will learn how to acquire and analyze raw next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from single cell sequencing.

What you'll learn
#################

The following topics will be covered:

  - Acqusition of NGS raw reads
  - Raw reads evaluation and cleaning
  - Species identification
  - De novo assembly and quality control
  - Genome annotation
  - Resistome and virulome analysis
  - Identification of variants of interest
  - Phylogenetic analysis
  - Pangenome identification


What you'll build
#################

  - A complete or draft microbial genome
  - A report of specific genotypic features
  - A comparative genomic analysis
